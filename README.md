# Supply Chain Planning Cloud Gateway (SCPCG) MVP
SCPCG is a middleware solution capable of consuming and leveraging master and transactional data from SAP and external systems for general planning purposes, integrating ERPs and supply chain planning platforms as-a-Service.
For the scope of MVP, the core function of SCPCG is extraction of SAP master and transactional data, transformation and integration to demand planning platforms (O9) using InterSystems Supply Chain Orchestrator.
The target document is then shared to O9 for demand planning purposes.

This repository contains code and data artifacts for Supply Chain Planning Cloud Gateway (SCPCG) MVP build, a solution that leverages InterSystems Supply Chain Orchestrator to accelerate integration between SAP and O9, which utilizes the extraction of SAP data via SAP extractors.
Data is extracted from SAP , submitted into InterSystems Supply Chain Orchestrator and transformed to a format that is accepted by O9 for demand planning.
